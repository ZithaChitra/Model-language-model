_____Mini_Journal_____

Think of this file as a mini journal which will contain some of my ideas, thoughts, and questions, that i have and that may 
surface throughout the process of building this project. These may be scientifical and/or philosophical, but really
nothing original or profound for that matter. I suppose in simple terms this is a doucumentation of my thought process in 
trying to "make this project work". It is important to note however that i'm just a self taught student in the fields of both
computer programming and artificial intelligece and therefore i might have limited knowledge in some things. In that extent,
don't take anything i say too seriously.

__one_more_thing_(before i begin)__
-> The codebase for this project is based on this repo https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/fsdl-text-recognizer, 
   which is provided as part of this amazing MLOps course https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/ .

-> What is a language_
   What is a language ? This is a question i find myself asking every once in a while, and the simplest answer is just
   one google search away. On Wikipedia it says "a language is a structured system of communication used by humans
   consisting of speech (spoken language), gestures (sign language) and writing" and i think this definition will do
   for now. The keyword in that definition is "structured", which simply means there are _rules_ for each language, and
   in the context of written language (which is the focus of this repo) these rules are what we call grammar.
